# Need-Gap-Measurement  Updated 1/16
This repository contains a short demonstration of the PowerBI visualizations I built as an intern 2+ years ago. This helped me gain the trust of Executives and Directors at Good360 early on which has led to my incredible opportunity of influence. It is amazing to see how far we've come, soon enough I'm sure I'll be able to externalize some of my work to show all the good we do.

I was brought onto Good360 towards the beginning of the "Need Gap Measurement Project", a project seeking to use data to drive intentionality behind donation placement. This dashboard and the data cleaning needed for it have been centerpiece of this project as it has helped Good360 map need and Nonprofit coverage in ways previously impossible.

Enjoy a quick demonstration of the dashboard largely responsible for taking me from expendable intern to an integral part of the operation as a driving force behind Good360's data culture emergence. I have presented this dashboard to the CEO and upper management and have received extremely positive feedback. The Senior VP of Nonprofit Development said it was "the most impactful thing an intern has accomplished in his time at Good360" and when he presented it in a meeting with the board of directors it received the "only round of applause he had heard in two years".

I am extremely proud of this work since it will surely lead to more donations and nonprofit development in areas with currently low coverage thus, helping Good360 shrink the need gap one person at a time and creating a very rare impact on communities across the US.

In this video you will see a variety of functionalities including, being able to filter all fields by state, region, membership level, date. My favorite functionality is the reactivity when you click on a county or a nonprofit; when you click on either, the other will react. For example, click on LA County and you will be able to see the different NPO's within 250 miles, how much product those NPOs have received, and their estimated lives impacted. Vice versa if you click on NPO "X" you will be able to see the amount of poverty in that 300 mile radius as well as the percent of poverty. All of this together, this dashboard allows our nonprofit development team to identify areas of potential growth allowing us to shrink the need gap.

# Need-Gap-Measurement
This repository contains r code used to clean sales order data for analysis and visualization in Tableau and PowerBI as well as a short demonstration of the PowerBI visualizations.
I was brought onto Good360 towards the beginning of the "Need Gap Measurement Project", a project seeking to use data to drive intentionality behind donation placement.  Enjoy a quick demonstration of the dashboard largely responsible for taking me from expendable intern to an integral part of the operation as a driving force behind Good360's data culture emergence. I have presented this dashboard to the CEO and upper management and have received extremely positive feedback. The Senior VP of Nonprofit Development said it was "the most impactful thing an intern has accomplished in his time at Good360" and when he presented it in a meeting with the board of directors it received the "only round of applause he had heard in two years".

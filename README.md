# Need-Gap-Measurement
This repository contains r code used to clean sales order data for analysis and visualization in Tableau and PowerBI as well as a short demonstration of the PowerBI visualizations.

I was brought onto Good360 towards the beginning of the "Need Gap Measurement Project", a project seeking to use data to drive intentionality behind donation placement. This data cleaning and dashboard have been a large part of this as it has helped Good360 map need and Nonprofit coverage in ways previously impossible.

Enjoy a quick demonstration of the dashboard largely responsible for taking me from expendable intern to an integral part of the operation as a driving force behind Good360's data culture emergence. I have presented this dashboard to the CEO and upper management and have received extremely positive feedback. The Senior VP of Nonprofit Development said it was "the most impactful thing an intern has accomplished in his time at Good360" and when he presented it in a meeting with the board of directors it received the "only round of applause he had heard in two years".

I am extremely proud of this work since it will surely lead to more donations and nonprofit development in areas with currently low coverage thus, helping Good360 shrink the need gap one person at a time and creating a very rare impact on communities across the US.
